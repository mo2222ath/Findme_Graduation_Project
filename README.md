# findme Project:

A person may go missing through a voluntary disappearance, or else due to an 
accident, crime, death, or many other reasons. Accordingly, some missing 
person cases remain unresolved for many years. The International Commission 
on Missing Persons disseminates information and images of lost people to 
improve the effectiveness of missing investigations, but still, itâ€™s not fast 
neither efficient way. So, we propose a system that would help the public by 
accelerating the process of searching using face recognition. Our facial 
recognition system uses machine learning to identify similarities in faces seen 
on different pictures so in case someone is missing the system offers a quick 
facial search action, the people related to that person can upload the picture of 
the person which will get stored in the database. When the public encounter a 
suspicious person, they can capture and upload the picture of that person into 
our portal. The face recognition model in our system will try to find a match in 
the database. If a match is found, system will provide a communication room 
between the one who uploaded the picture and the people related to that 
person to help arranging an appointment.
